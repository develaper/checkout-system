## Objective

Build an application responding to these needs. 

By application, we mean:
- It has a UI, where the user is able to add products to a cart and compute the total price (it can be a simple CLI)
- It is usable while remaining as simple as possible
- It is readable
- It is maintainable
- It is easily extendable

## Technical requirements

* Ruby version: 2.6.5

## Running the application

In order to run the CLI, you can run from the root folder:

    ruby lib/checkout.rb GR1 SR1 GR1
    =>19.34â‚¬

The propper syntax for the items codes is capital letters, separetad by blank space, no comas and no brackets. 


## Running the tests

For running the tests provided, you will need the Minitest gem. Open a
terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:

    gem install minitest
Or:
    bundle install

If you would like color output, you can `require 'minitest/pride'` in
the test file, or note the alternative instruction, below, for running
the test file.

In order to run the test, you can run a single test file from the test directory, e.g.:
    ruby shop_test.rb

Or the whole set from the root folder running:
    rake test

## Design Description

What we want to implement:

* A shop that sells different items.

* A cart that can hold items.

* A till that calculates the cost of a cart's items.

* An offer is any possible rule for a discount.

* A checkout process responsible for the input and output.

Design:

* `Shop` Keeps items info and provides item's costs.

* `Cart` holds items.

* `Till` calculates total cost based on cart items, shop costs and applied offers, and is functional.

* `Offer` calculates discounts and is functional.

* `Checkout` is a command line interface.

## Notes about the implementation and the flow:

For the seek of clarity, and trying to ilustrate my usual process to approach a development and tackel different phases, you can find that I have divided the development in 2 PRs.
First, for the basic classes needed to deliver a full checkout process, and second, for the offers' implementation. Both are covering the "happy path" assuming that no invalid input was going to be provided.

TO DO:

* Of course, covering the not-so-happy path where the input is invalid.
